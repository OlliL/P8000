**	Algorithm - determine whether query is connected or not
**
**	Algorithm takes a linked list of query components
**	and groups them according to the variables involved
**	in each component. If the query is fully interconnected
**	then algorithm returns TRUE else it returns FALSE.
**
**	By definition a constant clause (one involving zero variables)
**	is considered to use all variables. Without this rule,
**	a query with a null target list would always break into
**	two pieces.
**
**	Whether a query is fully connected is independent
**	of whether there are any one variable components
**	or not. This includes the target list. After applying
**	the algorithm, a scan is made to see how many multi-var
**	components are present. If there are two or more multi-var
**	components then the query is disconnected.
