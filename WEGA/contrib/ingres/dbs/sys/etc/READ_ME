in this directory are critical for the system to run.  The important
files are:

	READ_ME     --	this text
	amx_ixc6.3  --	the AMX compiler file for BS C
	amx_ixf6.3  --	the AMX compiler file for BS FORTRAN 77
	amx_msc6.3  --	the AMX compiler file for MSDOS MICROSOFT C
	creatdb_use --	printed out by the CREATDB when there
		is something wrong.  Right now it is quite short,
		but you could give a verbose message if that is
		appropriate for your user population.
	customer    --	identification stuff
	dayfile6.3  --	the dayfile printed out when
		IQL starts up.
	dbtmplt6.3  --	the template for a database; this file
		drives creatdb.
	error6.3_1  --	these files contain the error messages
		that the EQL system prints out.
	error6.3_2  --	these files contain the error messages
		that the PARSER system prints out.
	error6.3_3  --	these files contain the error messages
		that the QRYMOD system prints out.

		that the OVQP/DECOMP system prints out.
	error6.3_5  --	these files contain the error messages
		that the DBU system prints out.
	error6.3_10 --	these files contain the system errors
		that the ACCESS module prints out.
	error6.3_11 --	these files contain the system errors
		that the DBU module prints out.
	error6.3_12 --	these files contain the system errors
		that the DECOMP module prints out.
	error6.3_13 --	these files contain the system errors

	error6.3_19 --	these files contain the system errors
