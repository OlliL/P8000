/* iobuf.h */

/*
 * Each block device has a iobuf, which contains private state stuff and 2 list
 * heads: the b_forw/b_back list, which is doubly linked and has all the buffers
 * currently associated with that major device; and the d_actf/d_actl list, 
 * which is private to the device but in fact is always used for the head and 
 * tail of the I/O queue for the device. Various routines in bio.c look at 
 * b_forw/b_back (notice they are the same as in the buf structure) but the rest
 * is private to each device driver.
