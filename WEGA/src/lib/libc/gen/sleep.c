 * Suspend the process for `sleep_tm' seconds - using alarm/pause
 * system calls.  If caller had an alarm already set to go off `n'
 * seconds from now, then Case 1: (sleep_tm >= n) sleep for n, and
 * cause the callers previously specified alarm interrupt routine
 * to be executed, then return the value (sleep_tm - n) to the caller
 * as the unslept amount of time, Case 2: (sleep_tm < n) sleep for
 * sleep_tm, after which, reset alarm to go off when it would have
 * anyway.  In case process is aroused during sleep by any caught
 * signal, then reset any prior alarm, as above, and return to the
 * caller the (unsigned) quantity of (requested) seconds unslept.
